              With profound vulnerability and hard-won wisdom, Milind Birajdar has written a book that is not just about finding a job—it's about finding yourself when the ground beneath you disappears. At-Will but Unbreakable is resilience in its purest form: a deeply human account of staring into the abyss of professional failure and emerging stronger, more centered, and unshakable.
              <br><br>Birajdar transforms his darkest moment into a masterclass in self-discovery, blending practical career strategies with timeless philosophical wisdom. This book is a lifeline for anyone feeling adrift in their career, a powerful reminder that our worth is never defined by our job title, but by our capacity to endure, adapt, and grow. Read it when you need it most — it will not let you down.
